Comment:
 Both ofx201.dtd and ofx160.dtd are from the Open Financial Exchange
 standard (more recent versions are at www.ofx.net).
 .
 Further clarification of the license terms from the OFX Foundation says that
 the restriction which appears to only allow things which "conform to
 this Specification" means specifically that if an implementation
 claims to conform to OFX but does not then there is a problem, but
 otherwise there is none:
 .
  As long as your software doesn't state that it uses OFX (i.e. doesn't
  mention what it uses), then all should be fine.
 .
  The bottom line seems to be that it is fine if you use OFX technology as
  long as you do not represent your own enhanced version (added to or
  changed) as official "OFX".
 .
  Your software need not implement the whole DTD.
 .
 This thus permits the distribution of modifications (a key question),
 provided that there is no inaccurate claim made about OFX compliance.
